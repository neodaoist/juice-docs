# Distribution

**Distribution** allows you to commit portions of each withdrawal to Ethereum addresses or Juicebox projects. Distribution percentages are relative to the funding target (see [funding.md](funding.md "mention")).  By default, non-allocated funds will be withdrawn to the project owner's wallet.

Payouts allow for a lock date which prevents them from being changed or removed until a specific date (or until the funding cycle is reconfigured).
